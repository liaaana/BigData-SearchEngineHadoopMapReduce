thumb|Alice MacDonell in 1893Photograph from The Celtic Monthly, vol.1 1893 Alice MacDonell (31 January 1854 – 12 October 1938) was a Scottish poet who claimed to be Chieftainess of the MacDonell clan of Keppoch, and was recognised as bardess to that clan. Her full name and title was Alice Claire MacDonell of Keppoch, or in Scottish Gaelic Ailis Sorcha Ni' Mhic 'ic Raonuill na Ceapaich. She wrote verses as “Alice C. MacDonell of Keppoch”. == Life == Born in 1854 at Kilmonivaig in the Scottish Highlands, Alice MacDonell was the youngest child and eighth daughter of Angus McDonnell (titled Angus XXII of Keppoch) and his wife Christina (née MacNab). Her great-great grandfather was the Keppoch who led the MacDonalds at Culloden. She was educated by private tuition, and at the Convent of French Nuns in Northampton and at St. Margaret's Convent, Edinburgh. She gave early signs of the gift of poetry, stringing together couplets on incidents she had heard, her favourites being tales of battle and chivalry. She was steeped in the Jacobite sentiment of her ancestors, composing about the heroics of the Rising, though she also included more contemporary examples such as The Highland Brigade at the Battle of the Alma, The Rush on Coomassie, and the Gordon Highlanders at Dargai Heights. She was Bardess to the Clan MacDonald Society. Her poetry was composed in English, with occasional use of nominal Gaelic titles.Mathis, Kate Louise & Thomson, Eleanor, '"Our poetry never lacks clarity if read in Gaelic": Demystifying Gaelic and Anglo-Highland Women's Writing in the Celtic Revival', in Brown, Rhona & Lyall, Scott (eds.), Scottish Literary Review Spring/Summer 2022, Association for Scottish Literature, pp. 1 - 41, She did not marry.
