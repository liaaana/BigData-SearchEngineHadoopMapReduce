Attheya is a genus of small single celled diatoms. Some of these species were earlier regarded to belong to Chaetoceros, or to Gonioceros, the taxonomic status of some of these species are still debated.Crawford, R.M., Hinz, F. and Koschinski, P. 2000. The combination of Chaetoceros gaussii (Bacillariophyta) with Attheya. Phycologia 39(3):238-244. ==Description== They are distinguished morphologically from Chaetoceros by the structure of valve outgrowths or girdle bands. The girdle bands can only be seen with an electron microscope.Crawford, R. M., Gardner, C., Medlin, L. K. 1994. The genus Attheya. I.

Vegetative cells tend to attach to different substrates, including other diatoms,Tomas, C. R., Hasle G. R., Syvertsen, E. E., Steidinger, K. A., Tangen, K., Throndsen, J., Heimdal, B. R., (1997).
