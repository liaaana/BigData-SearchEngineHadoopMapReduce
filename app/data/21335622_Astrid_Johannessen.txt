Astrid Hitland Johannessen (born 10 January 1978) is a Norwegian former footballer who played as a goalkeeper for the Norway women's national football team. She was understudy to Bente Nordby on the Norwegian team that hosted UEFA Women's Euro 1997 and then finished fourth at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup in the United States. Johannessen won the Toppserien league with her club Asker in 1998 and 1999. She signed for professional English club Fulham in August 2001, agreeing to join in an initial loan deal after the 2001 Norwegian season. Fulham won the treble in season 2002–03, but Johannessen and several other players then left when the women's team lost its professional status. In August 2010 Johannessen kept goal for Amazon Grimstad in their 4–1 Cup quarter-final defeat by Røa IL. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian women's footballers Category:Norway women's international footballers Category:Arna- Bjørnar players Category:Fulham L.F.C. players Category:FA Women's National League players Category:Toppserien players Category:IF Fløya players Category:Asker Fotball (women) players Category:SK Brann Kvinner players Category:Amazon Grimstad players Category:Norwegian expatriate women's footballers Category:Norwegian expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Expatriate women's footballers in England Category:1999 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:Women's association football goalkeepers
