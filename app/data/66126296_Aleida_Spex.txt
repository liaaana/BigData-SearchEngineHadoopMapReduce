Aleida Spex (born June 16, 1955) is a Cuban-American former professional tennis player. Born in Cuba, Spex defected while competing at the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games in Santo Domingo, where she won three medals for her native country. She initially sought refuge in the Embassy of Chile, but ended up in the United States. Spex settled in Miami and was able to secure sponsorship to enable her to play on the professional tour. She twice qualified for the main draw of the Wimbledon Championships, including in 1976 when she made it through to the third round, with wins over Christina Sandberg and Isabel Fern√°ndez. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Cuban female tennis players Category:American female tennis players Category:Cuban emigrants to the United States Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in tennis Category:Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalists for Cuba Category:Central American and Caribbean Games silver medalists for Cuba Category:Central American and Caribbean Games bronze medalists for Cuba Category:Competitors at the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:21st-century American women
