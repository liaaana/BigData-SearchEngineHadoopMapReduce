To provide jobs to them, he decides to build a huge steel plant with the assistance of foreign collaborators. But Ramappa (Pradeep Rawat) and his assistant (Kota Srinivasa Rao) oppose this. They hatch a plan to eliminate him. His son Ramakrishna (Nandamuri Balakrishna) thwarts the villain's plans. But the story takes a cruel twist as the villains strike at the heart of the family by using Bobby (Nandamuri Balakrishna). When Bobby was a small kid, the villains kidnapped him and threatened Ramakrishna to leave his father and save Bobby. Although Harischandra Prasad had no love for Ramakrishna, he loved his father, and for fulfilling his father's wishes, he stands to protect, and Bobby is said to be escaped from the house. But Ramappa and his followers make Bobby a professional killer at the age of 12 by another killer (Charanraj) and use him to kill Harischandra Prasad. The whole family, except Ramakrishna and his step-brother (Rahman), is unaware that Bobby killed Harischandra Prasad. Now Bobby is an adult and is a high-profile professional killer and returns to his land with the help of his newly found friend Deepu (Lakshmi Rai), who share a mutual love interest. His mission, in short, is to protect his father from Ramappa. In this process, it is revealed to the family members of Harischandra Prasad and the people that Bobby killed Harischandra Prasad and moreover, the antagonists frame Ramakrishna as the man behind the death of Harischandra. Frustrated and deeply hurt by this, Ramakrishna's stepmother (Jayasudha) and wife (Sukanya) and the people expel them both. Police arrest them and take them away for a secret encounter by Ramappa. Seeing this all, Ramakrishna's stepbrother, who was paralyzed earlier in an attempt to catch Bobby during the murder of Harischandra, springs back to life and reveals the whole truth to his family and the people. Meanwhile, Ramkrishna and Bobby team up and kill all the enemies together. Later Ramakrishna's stepmother apologizes for the ill-treatment by her and orders him to fulfill his dead father's wishes. ==Cast== * Nandamuri Balakrishna in a triple role as Harishchandra Prasad, Rama Krishna Prasad, and Bobby * Lakshmi Rai as Deepti * Jayasudha as Lakshmi * Sukanya as Rama Krishna Prasad's wife * Saloni as Shravani * Pradeep Rawat as Ramappa * Aditya Menon as Ramappa's brother * Kota Srinivasa Rao as Politician * Rahman as Rama Krishna Prasad's brother * Murali Sharma as DGP * Brahmanandam as Brahmi * Charanraj as Professional Killer * Venu Madhav as Petty Thief * Kasi Viswanath as Minister * M.
