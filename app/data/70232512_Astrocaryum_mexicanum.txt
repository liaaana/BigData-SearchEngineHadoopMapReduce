Astrocaryum mexicanum, the chocho palm, cohune palm, or chapay, is a species of cocosoid palm in the family Arecaceae, native to Mexico and Central America. It is very long-lived for a palm, reaching 140 years. Local people harvest its young inflorescences, its seeds, and its hearts for food. Covered with stout spines, it is hardy to USDA zone 10a, and is occasionally planted as an ornamental in places such as Hawaii and Southern California. ==References== mexicanum Category:Flora of Southwestern Mexico Category:Flora of Veracruz Category:Flora of Southeastern Mexico Category:Flora of Guatemala Category:Flora of Belize Category:Flora of El Salvador Category:Flora of Honduras Category:Flora of Nicaragua Category:Flora of Costa Rica Category:Plants described in 1853
