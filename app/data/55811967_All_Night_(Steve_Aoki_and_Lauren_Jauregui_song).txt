Billboards Kate Bain noted "All Night" sees Aoki's returning to "bright-light, electro- house grooves" after the hip-hop influenced production on his Kolony LP. Introduced by their managers, Aoki played different tracks to Jauregui and they exchanged ideas. Jauregui said they had agreed on an unfinished track with a "delicate side" which she then reworked, rewriting lyrics, changing melodies, adding a bridge, and creating the harmonies. She produced the vocals on the track. ==Music video== The song's music video was released on January 8, 2018, and features Jauregui pursuing a male lover in a nightclub and Aoki DJing at the same nightclub. The music video premiered on BuzzFeed before being released to YouTube. Billboard called the video "steamy" and "pretty trippy". ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2017â€“18) Peak position France (SNEP) 197 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2018) Position US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) 66 ==References== Category:2017 songs Category:2017 singles Category:Lauren Jauregui songs Category:Steve Aoki songs Category:Songs written by Steve Aoki Category:Songs written by Lauren Jauregui
