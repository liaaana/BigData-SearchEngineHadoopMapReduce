Ambt Delden is a former municipality in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It consisted of the countryside surrounding the city of Delden, which was a separate municipality. Ambt Delden existed from 1818 to 2001, when it became a part of Hof van Twente. It is a little known fact that the typical dutch dessert of "Vanillevla" found its origins with farmers from the area. ==References== ===Notes=== Category:Municipalities of the Netherlands disestablished in 2001 Category:Former municipalities of Overijssel Category:Hof van Twente
