ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 4D is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ARL4D gene. == Function == ADP-ribosylation factor 4D is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor family of GTP-binding proteins. ARL4D is closely similar to ARL4A and ARL4C and each has a nuclear localization signal and an unusually high guanine nucleotide exchange rate. This protein may play a role in membrane-associated intracellular trafficking. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS). ==Model organisms== Arl4d knockout mouse phenotype Characteristic Phenotype Homozygote viability Normal Fertility Normal Body weight Normal Anxiety Normal Neurological assessment Normal Grip strength Normal Hot plate Normal Dysmorphology Normal Indirect calorimetry Normal Glucose tolerance test Normal Auditory brainstem response Normal DEXA Abnormal Radiography Abnormal Body temperature Normal Eye morphology Normal Clinical chemistry Normal Haematology Normal Peripheral blood lymphocytes Abnormal Micronucleus test Normal Heart weight Abnormal Skin Histopathology Normal Brain histopathology Abnormal Eye Histopathology Normal Salmonella infection Normal Citrobacter infection Normal All tests and analysis fromMouse Resources Portal, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

A conditional knockout mouse line, called Arl4dtm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi was generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium program — a high- throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists. Male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion. Twenty five tests were carried out on mutant mice and significant abnormalities were observed. Homozygous mutant females had decreased bone mineral content, heart weight, lean body mass and CD8-positive, alpha-beta memory T cell number. Males had abnormal rib morphology with vertebral transformation. Both sexes displayed a reduction in dorsal third ventricle area and hippocampal area. == References == ==External links== * * == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * Category:Genes mutated in mice
