American Scout Seamount appeared on charts of the North Atlantic Ocean published during the 1950s. It was located near with a depth of 37 meters. Investigations by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution research vessel Atlantis II in 1964 found no evidence that it existed. Extensive surveys by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office eventually disproved the existence of a seamount in the vicinity. A June 1966 bathymetric and magnetic survey by the new survey ship found no evidence of a seamount with no soundings less than but did find strong returns from the Deep Scattering Layer that could be mistaken for shoals. ==References== Category:Seamounts of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Phantom islands of the Atlantic
