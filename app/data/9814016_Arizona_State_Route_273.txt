SR 273 was designated in 1955 from SR 73 (this section now part of SR 260) southeast and northeast to SR 73, with a spur southeast. On August 16, 1991, the section from the spur northeast was renumbered as SR 261. SR 273 was rerouted over SR 273 spur, eliminating the duplication of mileposts.

It curves towards the southeast as it passes the reservoir. It curves towards the south as it intersects National Forest Service Road 87.

The segment between Sunrise and SR 261 was formerly an unpaved gravel road. ==Junction list== ==References== 273 Category:Transportation in Apache County, Arizona Category:White Mountains (Arizona)
