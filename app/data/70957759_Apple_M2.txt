Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's "Enhanced 5-nanometer technology" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1. The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size. Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package. == Design == === CPU === The M2 has four high-performance "Avalanche" and four energy-efficient "Blizzard" cores, first seen in the A15 Bionic, providing a hybrid configuration similar to ARM DynamIQ, as well as Intel's Alder Lake and Raptor Lake processors. The high- performance cores have 192 KB of L1 instruction cache and 128 KB of L1 data cache and share a 16 MB L2 cache; the energy-efficient cores have a 128 KB L1 instruction cache, 64 KB L1 data cache, and a shared 4 MB L2 cache. It also has an 8 MB system level cache shared by the GPU. The M2 Pro has 10 or 12 CPU cores, and the M2 Max has 12. === GPU === The M2 integrates an Apple designed ten-core (eight in some base models) graphics processing unit (GPU). Each GPU core is split into 16 execution units, which each contain eight arithmetic logic units (ALUs). In total, the M2 GPU contains up to 160 execution units or 1280 ALUs, which have a maximum floating point (FP32) performance of 3.6 TFLOPs. The M2 Pro integrates a 19-core (16 in some base models) graphics processing unit (GPU), while the M2 Max integrates a 38-core (30 in some base models) GPU. In total, the M2 Max GPU contains up to 608 execution units or 4864 ALUs, which have a maximum floating point (FP32) performance of 13.6 TFLOPS. The M2 Ultra features a 60- or 76-core GPU with up to 9728 ALUs and 27.2 TFLOPS of FP32 performance. === Memory === The M2 uses 6,400 MT/s LPDDR5 SDRAM in a unified memory configuration shared by all the components of the processor. The SoC and RAM chips are mounted together in a system-in-a-package design. 8 GB, 16 GB and 24 GB configurations are available. It has a 128-bit memory bus with bandwidth, and the M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra have approximately , , and respectively. === Other features === The M2 contains dedicated neural network hardware in a 16-core Neural Engine capable of executing 15.8 trillion operations per second. Other components include an image signal processor, a PCIe storage controller, a Secure Enclave, and a USB4 controller that includes Thunderbolt 3 (Thunderbolt 4 on Mac mini) support. The M2 Pro and Max support Thunderbolt 4. Supported codecs on the M2 include 8K H.264, 8K H.265 (8/10bit, up to 4:4:4), 8K Apple ProRes, VP9, and JPEG. == Products that use the Apple M2 series == === M2 === * MacBook Air (M2, 2022) * MacBook Pro (13-inch, M2, 2022) * iPad Pro (11-inch, 6th generation) (2022) * iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 6th generation) (2022) * Mac Mini (2023) * Vision Pro (2024) === M2 Pro === * MacBook Pro (14-inch and 16-inch, 2023) * Mac Mini (2023) === M2 Max === * MacBook Pro (14-inch and 16-inch, 2023) * Mac Studio (2023) === M2 Ultra === * Mac Studio (2023) * Mac Pro (2023) == See also == * Apple silicon * Apple A15 * Rosetta 2 * Universal 2 binary * List of Mac models grouped by CPU type == References == Category:Computer-related introductions in 2022 Category:Apple silicon
