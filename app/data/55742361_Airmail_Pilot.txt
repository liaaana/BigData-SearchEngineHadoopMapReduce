Campbell commented that "If you are looking for a realistic airflight simulation, Airmail Pilot is not for you. Since its price is on the lower end of the software spectrum, I do recommend it for those looking for a quick, easy, enjoyable game with limited staying power." Another reviewer from Moves commented, "It can be fun and amusing, but it is not designed to hold an adult's attention for very long." ==Reviews== *Review in Kilobaud Microcomputing ==References== ==External links== * Airmail Pilot at Video Game Geek Category:1979 video games Category:Flight simulation video games Category:Instant Software games Category:TI-99/4A games Category:TRS-80 games Category:Video games set in Chicago Category:Video games set in Indiana Category:Video games set in Indianapolis Category:Video games set in Ohio
