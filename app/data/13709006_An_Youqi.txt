Finally, she was classified officially as a contestant for the program. After entering the competition, she started singing in all the events related to the programme, catching instantaneously the attention both from the media and the viewers. At the end, she won the competition and started preparing her first album. The debut album of An was released with EE Media, a record label where almost all the super girl contestants have been releasing their recordings. The sales of the album were highly successful, selling over a million of copies only in mainland China. After the release, she started a tour around many cities of China.
