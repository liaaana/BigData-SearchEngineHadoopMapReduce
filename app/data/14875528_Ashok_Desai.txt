Some of the cases of general interest include:- (a) Sakharam Binder77 (1975) BomLR 13. The delicate question of censoring plays in Maharashtra was curiously governed by the Bombay Police Act. The Police took the view that the tender morality of the Bombay audience could not withstand a play about illicit sexual relations. which struck down the pre censorship of dramatic performances. The play "Sakharam Binder" as being censored by the police on the ground of obscenity. Justice Kania (later on the Chief Justice of India) saw the play at a special audition. He set aside the police decision and also struck down the relevant provisions of the Act as unguided and unconstitutional The trial itself became the subject matter of books and other plays.After passing through the legal fire the play suddenly caught on and had the unique distinction of being performed in four languages, namely, Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi and English at the same time in the same city. The play became a popular paperbook and also led to a Marathi book by Sarang Kamlakar called "Binderche Divas". It again found a place later on the stage as a part of the theme of a Marathi play "Sex, Morality and Sakharam Binder". (b) Piloo ModiPiloo Mody Vs. State, Unreported.

The case advanced the proposition that land belonging to the State must be treated as being held in public trust and must realize a fair price."By lowering the standing threshold, articulating a quasi-trustee standard for the exercise of all government power, and fashioning a resolution that was prospective and ameliorative, Backbay anticipated the robust administrative law and public interest litigation (PIL) jurisprudence developed by the Supreme Court in later years.Divan Shyam; "Public Interest Litigation"; The Oxford Handbook of the Indian Constitution ; Oxford University Press 2016 page 663" (c) AntulayAIR 1981 Bom 422,also see 1984 (2) SCC 183 and 1988 (2 )SCC 764 in which cement was distributed by the Chief Minister to builders who happened to give donations to Indira Gandhi Pratishtan.
