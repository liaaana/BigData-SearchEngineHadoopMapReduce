Adel Wgdan Mahmood Al Chadli (; born 13 April 2000) is a Yemeni footballer who plays for Ittihad Kalba as a winger. ==Early life== Al Chadli was born in Aden, Yemen, but moved to Switzerland as a child. He is the son of former South Yemen and Yemen international footballer Wagdan Shadli, while his brother, Wajd Al Chadli, also plays football, and formerly played for Sion. ==Club career== Al Chadli began his footballing career with Swiss side Montreux-Sports at the age of six, where he reportedly attracted offers from English side Manchester United, as well as French sides Olympique Lyonnais and Paris Saint-Germain. He spent a short period of time training with Lyon in 2012. In 2014, he moved to the United Arab Emirates to join Al Ahli. He returned to Switzerland and joined Lausanne-Sport for a short stint, before joining Sion, where he featured once for the club's reserve team in the 2017–18 season. He returned to the United Arab Emirates in 2018, joining UAE Pro League side Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai. After impressive performances with Al- Ahli's youth teams, scoring twenty goals in forty-four games, he was invited to trial with Spanish side Barcelona in 2019. The following year, after a handful of appearances for Al-Ahli, he suffered an injury to his right metatarsal, which required surgery in April 2021. In August 2022, he signed with fellow UAE Pro League side Ittihad Kalba on a season-long loan. ==International career== Al Chadli was called up to the Switzerland under-18 team in 2018. In doing so, he became the first Yemeni footballer to become naturalised and feature for a European team. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League League League Cup Cup Other Other Total Total Club Season Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Sion II 2017–18 Swiss Promotion League 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai 2018–19 UAE Pro League 2 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 2019–20 4 0 3 0 0 0 7 0 2020–21 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2021–22 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 6 0 5 0 0 0 11 0 Ittihad Kalba 2022–23 UAE Pro League 2 0 1 0 0 0 3 0 Career total 9 0 6 0 0 0 15 0 ;Notes ==References== Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Swiss people of Yemeni descent Category:Yemeni footballers Category:Men's association football wingers Category:UAE Pro League players Category:Shabab Al Ahli Club players Category:FC Lausanne-Sport players Category:FC Sion players Category:Ittihad Kalba FC players Category:Yemeni expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in the United Arab Emirates Category:Yemeni expatriate sportspeople in the United Arab Emirates
