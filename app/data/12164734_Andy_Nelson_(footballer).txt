Andrew Nesbitt Nelson (born 5 July 1935) is a former football player and manager. As a player, he won the Football League with Ipswich Town in 1962. He entered management with Gillingham in 1971, but quit to manage Charlton Athletic in 1974, and was an immediate success with promotion from the Third Division in 1975. 1976 and 1977 saw top ten finishes in the league, but in the following two years Charlton had rely on last day results to escape relegation, and Nelson came under pressure. In 1979, he came under increased pressure as Mike Bailey was appointed as chief coach, and by March 1980 his contract had been cancelled after three successive defeats with Charlton in the relegation zone. ==Honours== Ipswich Town * Football League First Division: 1961–62 * Football League Second Division: 1960–61 Individual *Ipswich Town Hall of Fame: Inducted 2011 == References == == External links == * *Andy Nelson profile from the official Charlton Athletic website Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from the London Borough of Newham Category:Men's association football defenders Category:English footballers Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Ipswich Town F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. managers Category:Gillingham F.C. managers Category:English Football League managers
