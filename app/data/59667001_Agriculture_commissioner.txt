In the state governments of the United States, all 50 states have the executive position of agriculture commissioner, director of agriculture, or secretary of agriculture. This official is in charge of the state's agriculture department. The agriculture commissioners are organized at the national level by the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. The agriculture commissioner is elected in 12 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Texas. The powers and duties of the office vary from state to state, but are often substantial: in about 40 states, agriculture departments regulate the animal industry, and in roughly half the states, agriculture departments regulate food safety and meat inspection.Louis Jacobson, Where Have All the Democratic Agriculture Commissioners Gone?, Governing (February 26, 2016). In some states, the agriculture commissioner has more power. For example, in Florida the agriculture commissioner is one of three members of the Florida Cabinet (along with the governor and attorney general), giving the commissioner some influence over state policy beyond agriculture. In North Dakota, the agriculture commissioner sits on a number of important boards, such as the North Dakota Industrial Commission (which oversees the state-owned North Dakota Mill and Elevator and Bank of North Dakota). ==Departments== State Officeholder Title Term start Party Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries Commissioner January 2019 Republican Party Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Division of Agriculture Director February 17, 2016 Nonpartisan Arizona Department of Agriculture Director April 10, 2015 Nonpartisan Arkansas Department of Agriculture Secretary 2015 Nonpartisan California Department of Food and Agriculture Secretary January 12, 2011 Nonpartisan Colorado Department of Agriculture Commissioner February 17, 2015 Nonpartisan Connecticut Department of Agriculture Commissioner March 1, 2011 Nonpartisan Delaware Department of Agriculture Secretary January 25, 2017 Nonpartisan Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner January 3, 2023 Republican Party Georgia Department of Agriculture Commissioner January 12, 2023 Republican Party Hawaii Department of Agriculture Commissioner February 15, 2019 Nonpartisan Idaho Department of Agriculture Director January 2, 2007 Nonpartisan Illinois Department of Agriculture Director November 16, 2015 Nonpartisan Indiana Department of Agriculture Director January 8, 2018 Nonpartisan Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship Secretary March 1, 2018 Republican Party Kansas Department of Agriculture Secretary December 10, 2013 Nonpartisan Kentucky Department of Agriculture Commissioner 2016 Republican Party Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner January 14, 2008 Republican Party Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner 2019 Nonpartisan Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary December 23, 2014 Nonpartisan Massachusetts Department of Agriculture Commissioner February 6, 2015 Nonpartisan Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Gary McDowell Director December 2018 Nonpartisan Minnesota Department of Agriculture Thom Petersen Commissioner January, 2019 Nonpartisan Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce Commissioner 2018 Republican Party Missouri Department of Agriculture Director 2017 Nonpartisan Montana Department of Agriculture Christy Clark Director January 31, 2022 Nonpartisan Nebraska Department of Agriculture Director December 5, 2017 Nonpartisan Nevada Department of Agriculture Jennifer Ott Director March 4, 2019 Nonpartisan New Hampshire Department of Agriculture Commissioner December 9, 2017 Nonpartisan New Jersey Department of Agriculture Secretary February 10, 2009 Nonpartisan New Mexico Department of Agriculture Secretary 2011 Nonpartisan New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Commissioner January 9, 2014 Nonpartisan North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner February 8, 2005 Republican Party North Dakota Department of Agriculture Commissioner 2009 Republican Party Ohio Department of Agriculture Director February 16, 2012 Nonpartisan Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry Secretary January 10, 2011 Nonpartisan Oregon Department of Agriculture Director January 23, 2017 Nonpartisan Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Secretary January 20, 2015 Nonpartisan Rhode Island Department of Agriculture Commissioner 1998 Nonpartisan South Carolina Department of Agriculture Commissioner 2005 Republican Party South Dakota Department of Agriculture Hunter Roberts Secretary April 19, 2021 Nonpartisan Tennessee Department of Agriculture Dr. Charlie Hatcher Commissioner January 19, 2021 Nonpartisan Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner 2015 Republican Party Utah Department of Agriculture and Food Craig Buttars Commissioner January 5, 2021 Nonpartisan Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets Secretary January 5, 2017 Nonpartisan Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner May 21, 2021 Nonpartisan Washington State Department of Agriculture Director June 15, 2015 Nonpartisan West Virginia Department of Agriculture Commissioner January 16, 2017 Republican Party Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection Secretary January 7, 2019 Democratic Party Wyoming Department of Agriculture Director March 15, 2015 Nonpartisan ==References==
