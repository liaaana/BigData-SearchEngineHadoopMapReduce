The Afghanistan cricket team toured Zimbabwe in June 2022 to play three One Day International (ODI) matches and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. In April 2022, Zimbabwe Cricket confirmed the fixtures for the tour. The following month, the tour itinerary was changed slightly, bringing the matches forward by one week and reducing the number of T20Is from five to three. Afghanistan won the opening ODI match by 60 runs. Afghanistan also won the second ODI, with an unbeaten century from Ibrahim Zadran, to take an unassailable lead in the three-match series. Afghanistan won the third and final ODI by four wickets to win the series 3–0. In the T20I series, Afghanistan won the first match by six wickets. Afghanistan won the second T20I match by 21 runs to all win the series with a match to spare. Afghanistan won the final match of the tour by 35 runs to also win the T20I series 3–0. ==Background== Afghanistan were originally scheduled to tour Zimbabwe in July and August 2020 to play five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches, subject to lockdown restrictions being lifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was not part of the Future Tours Programme. In June 2020, the Zimbabwe cricket team resumed their training, after passing COVID-19 tests. On 20 July 2020, Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) requested clearance from the government for the tour to go ahead, with a spokesperson from ZC stating that Afghanistan were still committed to touring. However, on 8 August 2020, the tour was called off, following an increase of COVID-19 cases in Zimbabwe. A revised tour was scheduled to take place in February 2022. However, in January 2022, both cricket boards agreed to postpone the tour after Zimbabwe Cricket could not secure all the broadcasting services including the Decision Review System. Despite the second postponement, both cricket boards were working to reschedule the matches as soon as possible. In April 2022, the rescheduled dates for the tour were confirmed. ==Squads== ODIs ODIs T20Is T20Is * Craig Ervine (c) * Ryan Burl * Regis Chakabva * Tendai Chatara * Tanaka Chivanga * Luke Jongwe * Innocent Kaia * Takudzwanashe Kaitano * Clive Madande * Wesley Madhevere * Blessing Muzarabani * Dion Myers * Ainsley Ndlovu * Sikandar Raza * Milton Shumba * Donald Tiripano * Hashmatullah Shahidi (c) * Rahmat Shah (vc) * Fareed Ahmad * Yamin Ahmadzai * Ikram Alikhil (wk) * Fazalhaq Farooqi * Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk) * Riaz Hassan * Rashid Khan * Mohammad Nabi * Azmatullah Omarzai * Mujeeb Ur Rahman * Zia-ur-Rehman * Shahidullah * Ibrahim Zadran * Najibullah Zadran * Craig Ervine (c) * Ryan Burl * Regis Chakabva * Tendai Chatara * Luke Jongwe * Innocent Kaia * Clive Madande * Wesley Madhevere * Tadiwanashe Marumani * Blessing Muzarabani * Dion Myers * Ainsley Ndlovu * Sikandar Raza * Milton Shumba * Donald Tiripano * Mohammad Nabi (c) * Najibullah Zadran (vc) * Fareed Ahmad * Noor Ahmad * Sharafuddin Ashraf * Fazalhaq Farooqi * Usman Ghani * Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk) * Ihsanullah * Karim Janat * Rashid Khan * Nijat Masood * Azmatullah Omarzai * Darwish Rasooli * Afsar Zazai (wk) * Hazratullah Zazai Afghanistan also named Noor Ahmad and Nijat Masood as reserves in their ODI squad, and Zahir Khan and Sayed Shirzad as reserves in their T20I squad. ==Warm-up match== ==ODI series== ===1st ODI=== ===2nd ODI=== ===3rd ODI=== ==T20I series== ===1st T20I=== ===2nd T20I=== ===3rd T20I=== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:2020 in Afghan cricket Category:2022 in Afghan cricket Category:2020 in Zimbabwean cricket Category:2022 in Zimbabwean cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2022 Category:Afghan cricket tours of Zimbabwe Category:Cricket events postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic
