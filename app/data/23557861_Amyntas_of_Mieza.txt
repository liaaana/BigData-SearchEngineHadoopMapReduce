Amyntas (), son of Alexander from Mieza and brother of Macedonian general Peucestas, was appointed somatophylax of Philip III Arrhidaeus at Triparadisus in 320 BC. This appointment suggests that Antipater trusted Peucestas more than he did Peithon. == References == *Who's who in the age of Alexander the Great: prosopography of Alexander's empire Category:Somatophylakes Category:Ancient Greek generals Category:Ancient Macedonian generals Category:4th-century BC Greek people Category:Ancient Miezans
