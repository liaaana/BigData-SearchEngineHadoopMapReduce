Ahihud () is a moshav in the Western Galilee in northern Israel, about 9 km east of Acre. It was founded in 1950, settled by Jewish refugees from Yemen. It belongs to the Moshavim Movement and falls within the jurisdiction of the Mateh Asher Regional Council. The name of Ahihud is taken from a Biblical verse: "The leader of the tribe of Asher was Ahihud, son of Shlomi" (Numbers 34:27).Carta's Official Guide to Israel and Complete Gazetteer to all Sites in the Holy Land. (3rd edition 1993) Jerusalem, Carta, p.72, (English) Yizhaqi, Arie (ed.): Madrich Israel (Israel Guide: An Encyclopedia for the Study of the Land), Vol 3: Lower Galilee and Kinneret Region, Jerusalem 1978, Keter Press, p.269 (Hebrew) After sources of water enabling the establishment of permanent settlements were discovered in the region, kibbutz Yasur was founded. Its area is 1,800 dunams, and most of its residents are descendants of Yemenite Jewish refugees. == History == The moshav was established on the land of the depopulated Palestinian village of Al-Birwa. Conder and Kitchener thought that Al-Birwa preserves in its name the more ancient name of Beri (), mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (Pesahim iv.1 [26a]), seeing that both it and Kabul are mentioned together.Conder & Kitchener (1881), p. 270; cf. references to same place in the Tosefta (Mo'ed Ḳaṭan 2:16) and Babylonian Talmud (Baba Kama 80a; Eruvin 45a). Others, dissenting, think that Beri is to be recognised in the name Biriyya, ca. 2 km. north of Safed (q.v. Ishtori Haparchi, Kaftor wa-Ferach, vol. 2 chapter 11, p. 53 [note 14], Jerusalem 2007). According to Josephus, the villages in the immediate vicinity of Kabul were pillaged and burnt during the First Jewish revolt against Rome.Josephus, The Jewish War (2.18.9). As pointed out by , the translators of The Jewish War in 2.18.9 and in 3.3.1. have, in both cases, transcribed the Greek word Cabul (Gr. Χαβουλών), used there for this city in the original text, as Zabulon. A train station was opened in 2017. ==Archaeology== In 2008, a large Byzantine- era oil refinery was discovered on the outskirts on the moshav. Among the artifacts recovered during excavations were roof tiles, a marble colonnette, fragments of a marble chancel screen, stem lamps, a carved plate with a figure carrying a child and a bronze lamp chain. These items indicate that a church may have been located nearby and the olive press was situated inside a Byzantine monastery. An ancient complex for Producing Oil was discovered An archaeological excavation of the site was conducted in 2010 and in 2014 by Rafeh Abu-Rya, on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010, Survey Permit # A-5991; Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2014, Survey Permit # A-7138 ==References== ==External links== *Ahihud Authority for Development of the Galilee Category:Moshavim Category:Populated places established in 1950 Category:Populated places in Northern District (Israel) Category:1950 establishments in Israel Category:Yemeni-Jewish culture in Israel
