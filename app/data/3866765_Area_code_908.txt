Area code 908 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) in the northern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. The numbering plan area (NPA) comprises communities in Union County, Somerset County, northern parts of Middlesex County, Hunterdon County, Warren County, and parts of Morris County as well as some cell phones in Monmouth and Ocean Counties. ==History== Area code 201, originally the only area code for New Jersey when the North American Numbering Plan was created in 1947, had been the area code for all of northern and central New Jersey since 1958. In June 1989, New Jersey Bell announced a split of numbering plan area 201 to create a new area code, 908, in North Jersey. The area code became operational on January 1, 1990, which started a permissive dialing period for the 314 central offices during which existing telephone numbers in the service area could be dialed with 201 or 908 area codes.The Star Gazette, New 908 are code will take effect this Saturday, Thursday, June 6, 1991 The permissive dialing period ended on June 8, 1991, making the split fully effective.About Verizon New Jersey: Years 1985 to 1998 , Verizon Communications, accessed May 12, 2007. Customers in the remaining 201 area had to prefix existing and new numbers in 908 with 1-908. At the time of the split, 1.5 million access lines were served by the new area code. On January 1, 1997, 908 was reduced to its western portion, forming area code 732 in the central-eastern region of New Jersey.Newman, Andy.

Middlesex County is largely 908 in South Plainfield and parts of Edison (particularly Inman Avenue and north of Oak Tree Road) and Piscataway (particularly the New Market area near Plainfield). 908 and the Delaware Valley's 856 are the only area codes in the state that have yet to be overlaid. Before October 2021, area code 908 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, 988 was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code was therefore scheduled to transition to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021. ==See also== *Central Jersey ==References== ==External links== 908 908
