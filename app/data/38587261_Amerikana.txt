Amerikana is a comedy-drama film written and directed by James Merendino. A sort of free homage-remake of Easy Rider (1969), it was the thirteenth film created under Dogme 95 rules. Although produced in 2001, it wasn't released until 2007. ==Plot== When philosophy student Peter (Goorjian) is abandoned by his Danish girlfriend in Los Angeles, his friend Chris (Duval) invites him to South Dakota to claim a Harley Davidson he has inherited from an uncle. After he finds out it is an Italian Vespa, Chris decides to take it to L.A. anyway with a reluctant Peter, and they embark on a cross-country journey that allows them to explore the USA and discover the nature of people and their own contradictions. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Dogme 95 films Category:American independent films Category:Films directed by James Merendino Category:Films produced by Peter Aalb√¶k Jensen Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films
