Anything Is Possible is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Debbie Gibson, released on November 20, 1990, by Atlantic Records. The album features a collaboration between Gibson and veteran Motown songwriter Lamont Dozier, who co-wrote four of the album's tracks including the title single. "Stand Your Ground" marked Gibson's final collaboration with longtime producer Fred Zarr. At the time of the album's release in late 1990, Gibson was 20 years old and the late-1980s teen pop wave was near its end. The album was Gibson's first to not reach the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart, peaking at No. 41 in the United States. It made the top 40 of the Cashbox albums chart for one week, peaking at No. 38 on December 22, 1990, before descending down the chart. The album sold fewer copies than her previous two albums, Out of the Blue and Electric Youth, both of which had gone multi- platinum. Anything Is Possible was certified Gold by the RIAA. In Japan, the album reached No. 5 on the Oricon weekly albums chart and was certified Gold by the RIAJ. The album was released in March 1991 in the United Kingdom but stalled at No. 69. The title single reached the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album was included in the 2017 box set We Could Be Together, with two B-sides as bonus tracks. A special two-disc digipack edition was released by Cherry Red Records on March 18, 2022. ==Track listing== The LP and cassette releases have unique labels on their sides. Side A is labeled "NRG↑" (pronounced "energy up") for its upbeat songs while the ballad-oriented side B is "Mood Swings".
