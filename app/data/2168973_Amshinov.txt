When Menachem Kalish died in 1917 his son Yosef became the rebbe in Amshinov, and his other son, Shimon Sholom, became rebbe in Otwock ( Otvotsk). He was involved in the exodus of thousands of young men in Kletzk, Radin, Novhardok, and other yeshivas via Japan to Shanghai at the outbreak of World War II. By the time Shanghai came under Japanese control, it held 26,000 Jews. Shimon Sholom's son Yerachmiel Yehuda Myer Kalish (1901–1976) of Amshinov, was born in Przysucha ( Pshiskhe), Poland.
