Advanced Compatibility Engineering (commonly called ACE Body Structure) is the marketing name given to an automobile body structure design by Honda. It claims to distribute collision energy evenly and redirect it away from the passenger compartment, while at the same time, minimizing damage to other impacted vehicles. This is accomplished by using numerous grades of steel (typically four) which crumple in key areas and remain rigid in others.Honda Advanced Compatibility Engineering ACE.avi, HondaTiongNam's YouTube Channel, dated 1 June 2011, last accessed 21 August 2016 It is standard on all Honda and Acura models as of the 2017 model year. ==Vehicles equipped with the ACE body structure== * 2017–present Honda Clarity * 2017–present Honda Ridgeline * 2017–present Honda WR-V * 2016–present Honda BR-V * 2016–present Honda HR-V * 2014–present Honda Mobilio * 2013–present Honda Amaze * 2013–present Honda Brio * Honda Crosstour, since introduction * Honda CR-Z, since introduction * 2010–present Honda Insight * 2009–present Honda Fit * 2009–present Honda Pilot * 2008–present Honda Accord * 2007–present Honda CR-V * 2006–present Honda Civic * 2005–present Honda Odyssey * Acura ILX, since introduction * Acura ZDX, since introduction * Acura TLX, since introduction * 2009–2014 Acura TL * 2009–2014 Acura TSX * Acura RDX, since introduction * 2007–present Acura MDX * Acura RLX, since introduction * 2005–2012 Acura RL ==References== * OUR COLLISION-FREE FUTURE, Honda official info Category:Honda
