He approached fellow professional golfers Derrick Cooper, Denis Durnian, Phil Harrison and Carl Mason, and agreed a deal to manage their careers, operating with an initial £10,000 overdraft from a back room at Mere Golf Club. Soon after, in 1990, Chandler was approached by the young amateur player Darren Clarke, who went on to become one of his most successful players.James Mossop, "Chubby in the swing of success", The Daily Telegraph, 22 January 2006. Retrieved 19 March 2019. The golf management business steadily grew throughout the 1990s, until Chandler was approached by the Lancashire player Neil Fairbrother to manage the career of his young teammate, Andrew Flintoff. Flintoff went on to propel Chandler and his company into the spotlight during the 2005 Ashes series, while Fairbrother took a post at ISM himself after retiring from cricket in 2002About ISM, ISM website before setting up Phoenix Management in 2018. The increasing success of ISM, and particularly the original golf sector, became apparent in 2010 and 2011; after the victory of longtime client Darren Clarke at the 2011 Open Championship, ISM had represented four of the previous five major championship winners, namely Louis Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel, Rory McIlroy and Clarke himself. McIlroy left ISM in the autumn of 2011, later saying that ISM took his career in the wrong direction. McIlroy regretted his decision in 2010 to give up his PGA Tour card, and skipping the 2010 Players Championship at Sawgrass that year. Chandler's aversion to the PGA Tour was cited by McIlroy as one of the main reasons for their split. ==References== ==External links== * Category:English male golfers Category:European Tour golfers Category:British sports agents Category:English people of Turkish descent Category:People educated at Bolton School Category:1953 births Category:Living people
