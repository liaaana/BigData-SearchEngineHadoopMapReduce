He attended the University of Washington, where he graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1927. While there he worked in stage productions and worked with the school publications. In 1928 he co- founded the Seattle Repertory Playhouse with Florence and Burton James. Two plays produced there were written by Albert, L'Envoi and Funny Man. He also wrote books, on which two musicals were produced, Calico Cargo and San Juan Story. He took a leave of absence from the Playhouse to be a screenwriter at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He was a founding member of Seattle local of the American Federation of Radio Artists and chairman of its Negotiating Committee. Where he worked in the field of labor relations.

Because of this listing, he moved to New York City in 1951. The Canwell Committee was investigating communist activity on the University of Washington campus during the 1940s. Albert refused to answer questions based on his activities and beliefs, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, in addition to being put on the blacklist. The Playhouse also suffered from this and eventually closed (later reopened as the Seattle Repertory Theater). Albert moved to New York where he joined the Equity Union in 1951. Albert worked as an actor in New York until the blacklisting caught up with him, he then turned to working as a temporary typist. By the late 1950s, he was able to resume acting. ==Broadway== After the return to acting, Albert began working in television serials, commercials, and dramas.
