Andreas Alcibiades (; born 19 September 1991 in Nicosia) is a Cypriot winger who plays for Ayia Napa in the Cypriot Second Division. Despite his relatively young age he has been a regular starter for Olympiakos since 2007 mainly as a right winger and is considered a very promising young talent both for club and country. He has in January 2010 been awarded by the Cyprus media as the most promising young football talent and has thus also been called up to Cyprus national under-21 football team. ==External links== *Profile at footballdatabase.eu Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Cypriot footballers Category:Men's association football midfielders Category:Olympiakos Nicosia players Category:PAEEK FC players Category:Omonia Aradippou players Category:Othellos Athienou FC players Category:Ayia Napa FC players Category:Cyprus men's under-21 international footballers Category:Cypriot First Division players
