In economics, additive utility is a cardinal utility function with the sigma additivity property. Additive utility A u(A) \emptyset 0 apple 5 hat 7 apple and hat 12 Additivity (also called linearity or modularity) means that "the whole is equal to the sum of its parts." That is, the utility of a set of items is the sum of the utilities of each item separately. Let S be a finite set of items. A cardinal utility function u:2^S\to\R, where 2^S is the power set of S, is additive if for any A, B\subseteq S, :u(A)+u(B)=u(A\cup B)-u(A\cap B). It follows that for any A\subseteq S, :u(A)=u(\emptyset)+\sum_{x\in A}\big(u(\\{x\\})-u(\emptyset)\big). An additive utility function is characteristic of independent goods. For example, an apple and a hat are considered independent: the utility a person receives from having an apple is the same whether or not he has a hat, and vice versa. A typical utility function for this case is given at the right. == Notes == * As mentioned above, additivity is a property of cardinal utility functions. An analogous property of ordinal utility functions is weakly additive. * A utility function is additive if and only if it is both submodular and supermodular. == See also == * Utility functions on indivisible goods * Independent goods * Submodular set function * Supermodular set function == References == Category:Utility function types
