All Saints' Church is an active English-speaking chaplaincy of the Church of England's Diocese in Europe - a part of the Anglican Communion - in Rome, Italy. The church building is a Gothic revival red-brick construction, situated in the Via del Babuino, about 100 meters from the Spanish Steps. The architect was George Edmund Street (1824â€“1881). It has a regular weekly schedule of masses and prayer services and is used, as well, for concerts.
