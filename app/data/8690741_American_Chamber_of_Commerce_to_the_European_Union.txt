Starting off in the form of the ‘Common Market Panel’ in the early 1960s, the organization evolved over the years first to the ‘EEC Committee’ in 1978, then to the ‘EU Committee’ in 1995. The EU Committee changed its name to AmCham EU in 2003 and became an independent organization on January 1, 2004. In 2013, it celebrated its 50th anniversary. AmCham EU is a Belgian not-for-profit organization with its own secretariat and annual budget. AmCham EU has an Executive Council, a group of executives responsible for European operations of US multinationals. == Role and Purpose == The primary purpose of both AmCham EU and the Executive Council is to play an active role in the successful development of the Single Market throughout all EU Member States. They therefore direct their energies towards the EU institutions, the EU Member States, wider Europe and the US. AmCham EU seeks to serve as an independent source of quality information and analysis. Through participation in working policy groups, members prioritize issues, develop position papers, organize meetings, workshops, seminars and conferences which provide a platform for open exchange of information and ideas. The vision of AmCham EU is to be: * The most effective advocacy force in the EU; * The representation body for US business in the EU; and * A trusted discussion partner for European institutions and governments. AmCham EU believes in deepening and widening the EU Single Market, achieving a low-carbon economy, driving innovation, increasing trade and investment, and better preparing the workforce to meet future demands. By helping drive the transatlantic economy, AmCham EU shows it is heavily invested in and committed to Europe. This membership-led and membership driven organization is currently chaired by Karl Cox, Vice President of Global Public Affairs, Oracle Corporation. The Chief Executive Officer is Susan Danger, who oversees a secretariat of over 20 professional staff. == Policy Committees == # Agriculture & Food # Competition Policy # Consumer Affairs # Customs & Trade Facilitation # Digital Economy # Employment & Social Affairs # Environment # EU Tax # Financial Services # Healthcare # Institutional Affairs # Intellectual Property # Security & Defense # Trade & External Relations # Transport, Energy & Climate == Advocacy and Communications == AmCham EU's publications are distributed in Brussels and throughout Europe.
