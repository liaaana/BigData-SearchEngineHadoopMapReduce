Alexander Pope (176322 March 1835) was an Irish actor and painter. ==Life== He was born in Cork, Ireland. He was educated to follow his father's profession of miniature painting. He continued to paint miniatures and exhibit them at the Royal Academy as late as 1821; but at an early date he took the stage, first appearing in London as Oroonoko in 1785 at Covent Garden. He remained at this theatre almost continuously for nearly twenty years, then at the Haymarket until his retirement, playing leading parts, chiefly tragic. He was well known as Othello and Henry VIII. He played for the first time in Edinburgh on 15 June 1786, as Othello. ==Family== He was married three times. His first wife, Elizabeth (1744–1797), a favourite English actress of great versatility, was billed before her marriage as Miss Younge.Terry Enright, ‘Pope, Elizabeth (1739x45–1797)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 21 March 2015 His second wife, Maria Ann Campion (1775–1803), also a popular actress, was a member of an Irish family.
