Boetticher, who directed Murphy on The Cimarron Kid, was going through a similar slump. The two men formed their own company, Fipco (First International Planning Company) to make films. This was planned to be the first of several. A Time for Dying was to originally star Peter Fonda as the kid.Sean Axmaker, 'Ride Lonesome: The Career of Budd Boetticher', Senses of Cinema 7 February 2006 accessed 25 June 2012 Shooting took place at the Apacheland Movie Ranch near Tucson in April and May 1969. Money was tight and by the time filming was completed the movie was several minutes shorter than scripted. Murphy spent the next year and a half trying to raise additional funds for completion and post-production. Two of Murphy's sons made their motion picture debut appearing in small roles in the film, with Murphy's long term Associate Willard Willingham playing Frank James. Boetticher later said "Audie got in real trouble with some people in Las Vegas, and he needed a director to make a picture, and he would be the producer. He was a friend, and he was in trouble, so I made the picture for him. But then Audie was killed in a plane crash shortly after the film was finished (on May 28, 1971), so the whole thing was just tragic."Budd Boetticher: The Last Interview Wheeler, Winston Dixon.
