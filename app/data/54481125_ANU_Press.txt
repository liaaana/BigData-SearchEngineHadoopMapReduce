ANU Press (or Australian National University Press; originally ANU E Press) is new university press (NUP) that publishes open-access books, textbooks and journals. It was established in 2004 to explore and enable new modes of scholarly publishing. In 2014, ANU E Press changed its name to ANU Press to reflect the changes the publication industry had seen since its foundation. == History == ANU Press was Australia's first primarily electronic academic publisher. ANU Press justified its foundation by mentioning the desire to publish scholarly works that would not necessarily gain profit, and the belief that online publishing was a viable alternative to traditional academic publishing that overcame the inaccessibility, costs, and requirements for setup that were inherent in traditional publishing. == Activities == ANU Press produces on average 50–60 fully peer-reviewed research publications each year, and maintains a website featuring over 700 recent and back-list titles. It is recognised by the Department of Industry as a commercial publisher, enabling ANU Press authors to gain full recognition under the Higher Education Research Data Collection scheme. Nearly all books and journals published by the Press are available in PDF, epub, mobi and HTML formats. All works are also available to purchase in hard copy through a Print-on-Demand (PoD) service. ANU Press is multidisciplinary; it has 24 subject-specific editorial boards to evaluate monograph submissions and publishes 10 journals covering a wide range of disciplines. In order to ensure that the Press publishes only high-quality academic books, each submission goes through a rigorous selection process including evaluation by the relevant editorial board, a double-blind peer- review process, revision following reviewers’ reports and final approval by the board. This process ensures that the research is current, relevant and an important contribution to the field. === Imprints === As well as its titular imprint, ANU Press publishes work under two additional imprints: and .

In this way, ANU Press supports the Australian National University's commitment towards research that contributes to societal transformation, recognising that research, no matter how thorough, innovative or world-changing, is only useful if it is made readily available to those who can use it best rather than being treated as a commodity accessible only to those who can afford it. ==Journal publications== ANU Press publishes or co- publishes a number of academic journals, including: *Aboriginal History *Agenda * *Australian Journal of Biography and History *East Asia Forum Quarterly *Human Ecology Review *International Review of Environmental History ==See also== *Pacific Linguistics ==References== ==External links== * ANU Press home page Category:2004 establishments in Australia Category:Australian National University Category:Open access publishers Category:Academic publishing companies Category:University presses of Australia Category:Book publishing companies of Australia Category:Publishing companies established in 2004 Category:Online publishing companies
