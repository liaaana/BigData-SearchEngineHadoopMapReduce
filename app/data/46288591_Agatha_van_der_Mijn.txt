Since this poem shows that she was already active as a flower artist before 1718, it is possible that she accompanied her brother when he took his family and the family of his pupil Jacoba Maria van Nickelen to Dusseldorp in 1712-1713 to work for Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. The flower painter Rachel Ruysch was also active in Dusseldorp in the years 1712-1716 and Agatha's work, along with that of Nickelen and her niece Cornelia van der Mijn all show a similar style. In 1722 Herman van der Mijn moved to London with his family and she accompanied him.Heromen and Agatha Vandermijn in English Female Artists by Ellen Creathorne Clayton, 1876 Herman died a year after his son Robert sank through the ice at Marylebone in 1740 while ice-skating.

Vandermine, both of whom were related to the former. One of them painted for the shops, and there are many slight pictures of an Old Man, in a loose coat and hair cap, hugging a bag of money, which were painted, by one of these artists. The wife of one of them was also of the profession : She painted fruit and flowers, and they were all exhibitors at the Society's Rooms in the Strand, in the years 1761 and 1762.".Anecdotes of painters who have resided or been born in England : with critical remarks on their productions Sequel by Edwards, Edward, 1738-1806, after Walpole, Horace, 1717-1797 (Anecdotes of painting in England), 1808 == References == == External links == * Agatha van der Mijn in 1001 Vrouwen uit de Nederlandse geschiedenis * Category:1700 births Category:1780s deaths Category:18th-century Dutch painters Category:18th- century Dutch women artists Category:Painters from Amsterdam Category:Dutch women painters Category:Flower artists
