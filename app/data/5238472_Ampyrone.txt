Ampyrone is a metabolite of aminopyrine with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. Its use as a drug is discouraged due to the risk of agranulocytosis. It is used as a reagent for biochemical reactions producing peroxides or phenols. Ampyrone stimulates liver microsomes and is also used to measure extracellular water. ==References== Category:Pyrazolones Category:Analgesics Category:Antipyretics Category:Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs Category:Human drug metabolites
