Aghade Holed Stone or Cloghaphoill is a large holed stone and Irish National Monument located in Aghade, County Carlow, Ireland. ==Description== The holed stone is granite, measures approximately 2.4 x 1.56 x 0.46 metres, weighs close to 5 tonnes, and has a hole about in diameter near the top. ==History and legend== Archaeologists believe that the stone was originally a door to a megalithic tomb. The hole may have permitted the offering of food or other objects to the dead. The 14th-century Book of Ballymote offers a story where Niall of the Nine Hostages ties Eochaid, son of Ã‰nnae Cennsalach mac Labhradh (a 5th-century King of Leinster) to the Aghade Holed Stone and sends nine men to kill him: Up to the 18th century it was common for sick children to be passed through the hole, in the belief that this would cure them. ==References== Category:National Monuments in County Carlow
