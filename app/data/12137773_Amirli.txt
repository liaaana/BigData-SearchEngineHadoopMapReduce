It was running out of food, water, and supplies. A U.N. representative stated, "The situation of the people in Amerli is desperate and demands immediate action to prevent the possible massacre of its citizens." On August 31, the Iraqi army, with help from the United States and Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, managed to break the siege and entered the city, much to the rejoicing of its citizens. Iran had reportedly played a "military planning" role in breaking siege of Amirli. ==References== Category:Populated places in Saladin Governorate Category:Turkmen communities in Iraq
