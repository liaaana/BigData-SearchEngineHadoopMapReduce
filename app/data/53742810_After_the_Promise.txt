Struggling to bring up four young boys after the death of his wife, he is horrified when the government (citing trumped-up charges of parental neglect) places the boys into various foster homes and institutions, unaware of the abuse that boys would then be subjected to. The conditions imposed by the court and the difficulties caused by the Depression make Jackson's determined and vigorous quest to find his boys extremely difficult. ==Cast== * Mark Harmon as Elmer Jackson * Diana Scarwid as Anna Jackson * Rosemary Dunsmore as Florence Jackson * Donnelly Rhodes as Dr. Northfield * David French as Richard Jackson (age 10) * Don Jeffcoat as Richard Jackson (age 12) * Andrew Woodworth as Richard Jackson (age 15) * Benjamin Turner as Ellis Jackson (age 8) * Ryan Heavenor as Ellis Jackson (age 10) * Trey Ames as Ellis Jackson (age 13) * Chance Michael Corbitt as Wayne Jackson (age 6) * Ryan Francis as Wayne Jackson (age 8) * Dick Billingsley as Wayne Jackson (age 11) * Lance and Gary Verwoerd as Raymond Jackson (age 3) * Slone Romano as Raymond Jackson (age 5) * Mark Hildreth as Raymond Jackson (age 8) ==Reception== After the Promise received positive reviews from critics.
