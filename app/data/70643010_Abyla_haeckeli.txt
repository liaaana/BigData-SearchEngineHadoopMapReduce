Abyla haeckeli is a colonial siphonophore in the family Abylidae. It was described in 1908. ==Description== The species has an anterior nectophore that is the same width and length but it does not provide wing functions. A transverse ridge separates the ventral facet from the apico-ventral facet. The posterior nectophore can have up to 5 teeth on one comb. It also has lateral ostial teeth that are closer to the dorsal tooth rather than the ventral teeth. ==Distribution== The species has been reported near the Philippines and Japan in the upper parts of the water column. ==References== Category:Plankton Category:Species described in 1908 Category:Abylidae Category:Bioluminescent cnidarians
