Acetone is an album by the American alternative rock band Acetone, released in 1997. It was the band's first album for Neil Young's Vapor Records; Acetone's previous label, Vernon Yard, had declared bankruptcy. The album was produced by Scott Campbell and Acetone. The band supported the album by opening for Spiritualized on its North American tour. ==Critical reception== Pitchfork wrote that "[Richie] Lee's lyric sheet may have been filled with dejection ... but he always sang as if he was looking you in the eyes." The Times declared that "Mark Lightcap's country-tinged guitars are simply gorgeous." Noting that Acetone "belong somewhere in the slowcore/sadcore area," The Sunday Times thought that "their music isn't just unhurried, it's completely indifferent to the passing of time." The Guardian praised the "homespun, half-speed ballads." The San Antonio Express-News deemed the album "atmospheric pop with a hint of guitar twang and the feeling of a slow-motion undertow." AllMusic thought that the album "finds the trio sinking deeper into a well of despair, with nothing but sparse guitar pickings, cracked vocals, and shambling rock figures to help." MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide wrote: "Alternately draining and invigorating, the sheer listlessness of songs such as 'Might as Well' and 'Good Life' is resuscitated by the drunk and confident stare of jazz-bar reflection." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Steve Hadley - drums *Richie Lee - vocals, bass *Mark Lightcap - guitar, vocals ==References== Category:1997 albums
