The Afon Ysgethin is a short river in Gwynedd, Wales. Flowing entirely within Snowdonia National Park it rises beneath the peaks of Y Llethr and Diffwys within the Rhinogs mountain range and runs in a generally ESE direction towards Cardigan Bay. Headwater streams flow into a small upper lake, Llyn Dulyn, and Llyn Bodlyn reservoir. Originally a natural lake, Llyn Bodlyn was enlarged in 1894 to provide Barmouth with water.Roberts, Geraint. The Lakes of Eryri. Llanrwst: Carreg Gwalch, 1995. The river emerging from the reservoir is crossed by a historic track at Pont Scethin. This old stone arch bridge ("probably 18th century") was once used by packhorses and drovers moving between Harlech and London. A further 3 km downstream the river enters a narrower wooded valley and is crossed by Pont Fadog. An inscription on the bridge states that it was improved in 1762 by a mason called H. Edward, who was commissioned by William Vaughan, a member of the powerful owner family of nearby Cors-y-gedol hall (see Dyffryn Ardudwy). "Pont Fadog, Dyffryn Ardudwy". britishlistedbuildings.co.uk.

After another 1 km, the Afon Ysgethin enters the sea. ==Gallery== Llyn Bodlyn.jpg|Llyn Bodlyn Pont Scethin.jpg|Pont Scethin and Moelfre Pont Fadog.jpg|Pont Fadog Pont Fadog inscription.jpg|Inscription on Pont Fadog: W.V. 1762.
