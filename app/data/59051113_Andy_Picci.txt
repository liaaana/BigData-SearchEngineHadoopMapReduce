Andrea Picci is a conceptual artist and poet. Archived 21 September 2018. His work concerns celebrity and identity. == Early life == Picci grew up in Switzerland. He studied photography at ECAL, visual communication at ESAM Design in Paris, and has a MFA from Central Saint Martins in London. == Career == In 2015, Picci staged an artistic performance in which he dressed as Pete Doherty, fooling some photojournalists and having his picture published on Le Parisien's front-page as Doherty's. "By embodying a false Doherty on a photograph presented as a true one, the doppelgänger joined an appropriationist art process in a Richard Prince’s style, questioning the construction of identity (hello Cindy Sherman) and tackled our Society of the Spectacle," stated the French newspaper Les Inrockuptibles. In April 2017, Picci published a book of poetry, Essais de gloire (Anatomie de mon coeur en été). In June 2018, he showed a series of copies of historic paintings altered to resemble Nabilla Benattia. Benattia said she was "very flattered" by the exhibition. In 2019, he published a series of Instagram face filters. The filters questioned user's relation to selfie. == Publications == === Poetry === * Essais de Gloire (Anatomie de mon coeur en été), Éditions de la Marquise, Lausanne 2017. === Featured === *PZ World, IDEA ltd , PZToday , London 2018.
