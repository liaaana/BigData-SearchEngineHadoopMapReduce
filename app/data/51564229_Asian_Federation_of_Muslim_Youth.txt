The Asian Federation of Muslim Youth (AFMY), which was formally established in 2001/1422H, is an umbrella organisation of the Muslim youth and student organisations working at the national level in the Asian continent. The primary objective is to create a forum to discuss the activities, strategies, problems and experiences, and to co-ordinate and strengthen communication and exchange views. It aims to train community leaders to run these organisations in different countries and to encourage them to think and develop their own resources and to analyse the situation in the light of the Qur'an and Sunnah, take decisions through mutual consultations (Shoura) and work for the establishment of the Islamic equality and social justice. It hopes to evolve common training programs, action plans and campaign to present Islam in the contemporary parlance. It will strive for the protection of the rights of youth and students to form organisations in areas where there is no such bodies in action. Offices The General Secretariat is based in Colombo.
