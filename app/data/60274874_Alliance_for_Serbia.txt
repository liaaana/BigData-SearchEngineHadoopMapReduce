The Alliance for Serbia () was a major extra-parliamentary catch-all opposition alliance of political parties in Serbia that was founded in September 2018. The alliance boycotted the 2020 parliamentary election, due to claims that the elections would not be held under fair conditions. The alliance officially dissolved in August 2020, as the new alliance called United Opposition of Serbia was formed. ==History== Coalition was founded by Dragan Đilas in September 2018. The political background of alliance members is diverse, with both left-wing, liberal, moderate, right-wing and far-right factions voicing opposition to the government. It is composed of the Democratic Party, Dveri, People's Party, Party of Freedom and Justice, as well some minor and local anti-government parties and organisations. They have called for the institution of a technocratic transitional government which would serve for a period of 1 year after which elections would be held. The Alliance have supported protests against Vučić and have signed Agreement with people along with other opposition parties on 6 February. The protests were precipitated by an assault on Borko Stefanović, one of the leaders of the Alliance. The non-partisan expert group, introduced during protests, concluded there were no conditions for free and fair elections in the country, due to the lack of public communication and inequality in that process, and they drafted a comprehensive and systematic document with six demands and six annexes. On September 16, 2019, the parties of the Alliance had taken a joint decision to boycott the coming parliamentary elections. In October, the first round of inter-party European Parliament-mediated dialogue took place, while the Alliance for Serbia refused to participate, stating that there is no time for their demands for fair election conditions to be met before April, when the election is scheduled. ==Members== Name Name Leader Main ideology Political position MPs Democratic Party Zoran Lutovac Social liberalism Pro-Europeanism Centre to centre-left Dveri Boško Obradović Serbian nationalism Social conservatism Right wing to far-right People's Party Vuk Jeremić Liberal conservatism Pro-Europeanism Centre-right Party of Freedom and Justice Dragan Đilas Social democracy Pro-Europeanism Centre-left Fatherland Slaviša Ristić National conservatism Christian democracy Right-wing Movement for Reversal Janko Veselinović Social democracy Social liberalism Centre-left United Trade Unions "Sloga" Željko Veselinović Syndicalism Democratic socialism Left-wing === Parties that left coalition === Name Leader Main ideology Political position MPs Together for Serbia Nebojša Zelenović Social democracy Green politics Centre-left Healthy Serbia Milan Stamatović National conservatism Euroscepticism Right-wing == Electoral results == === Parliamentary elections === Year Popular vote % of popular vote # of seats Seat change Status 2018 Coalition formed 23 2020 Election boycott 23 no seats ==See also== *United Opposition of Serbia, the successor of this political alliance. ==References== ==External links== *Alliance for Serbia Official website Category:2018 establishments in Serbia Category:2020 disestablishments in Serbia Category:Defunct political party alliances in Serbia Category:Political parties disestablished in 2020 Category:Political parties established in 2018 Category:Democracy movements Category:Political opposition organizations Category:Parliamentary groups
