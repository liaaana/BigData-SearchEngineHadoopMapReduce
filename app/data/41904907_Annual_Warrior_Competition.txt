The Annual Warrior Competition is a combat-oriented competition that pits special operations military and police teams against each other. Teams are assessed in events testing physical fitness, marksmanship drills, medical tasks and written exams. The competition takes place at the King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Centre (KASOTC) in Amman, Jordan. Jordan created the competition in May 2009. ==Background== The competition is hosted at the King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Centre, also known as KASOTC. Every year the competition is redesigned to reflect the ever-changing threats posed by terrorism. Competing “Warriors” are expected to demonstrate competencies and adaptability of marksmanship, endurance, teamwork, tactics and communications on the battlefield. They are observed and judged by a panel of reputable international experts from various professional military and law enforcement backgrounds. Many international and local teams participate every year. The 12th Annual Warrior Competition, which was scheduled to occur in 2020, was postponed and later held in 2022 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. == Annual Warrior Competition (AWC) Results == Competition Year Teams Countries Winning Country Winning Team Name 12th AWC 2022 40 26 Jordan Royal Guards - Jordanian Armed Forces (Team 1) 11th AWC 2019 46 26 Brunei Rejimen Pasukan Khas - Royal Brunei Armed Forces (Team 1) 10th AWC 2018 40 24 Lebanon Black Panthers - Internal Security Forces 9th AWC 2017 33 17 China Sky Sword Unit - People's Armed Police 8th AWC 2016 27 11 Lebanon Black Panthers - Internal Security Forces (Team 2) 7th AWC 2015 37 18 Russia SOBR "Terek" - Rosgvardiya (Team 1) 6th AWC 2014 33 19 China Snow Leopard Commando Unit - People's Armed Police 5th AWC 2013 30 17 China Snow Leopard Commando Unit - People's Armed Police 4th AWC 2012 35 18 Germany GSG9 – Federal Police 3rd AWC 2011 22 12 Austria Einsatzkommando Cobra - Ministry of the Interior 2nd AWC 2010 10 4 United States 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit - United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance 1st AWC 2009 7 2 Jordan General Intelligence Directorate ==References== ==External links== * *New York Times - Sleep Away Camp for PostModern Cowboys *Small Arms Defence Journal - THE WARRIOR COMPETITION, “THE KING’S CHALLENGE” *KASOTC Official Website Category:Events in Jordan Category:Military of Jordan Category:Spring (season) events in Jordan
