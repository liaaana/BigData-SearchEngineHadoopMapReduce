He served in the Royal Marine Light Infantry and became a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Anderson is buried in Brompton Cemetery in London. His memorial is an unusual composition of cannonballs, one of which has disappeared. In 2018 the missing cannonballs have been replaced and the group has been added to. Three of the cannonballs are inscribed, individually bearing the words 'Beyrout', 'Gaza' and 'Syria'. The grave lies on the east side of the main path, midway between the north entrance and the colonnades. ==References== Category:1807 births Category:1877 deaths Category:Royal Marines generals Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Burials at Brompton Cemetery Category:19th-century Royal Marines personnel
