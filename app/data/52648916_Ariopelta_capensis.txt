Ariopelta capensis is a species of air-breathing land slug, a terrestrial, pulmonate, gastropod mollusk in the family Oopeltidae. Ariopelta capensis is the type species of the genus Ariopelta. ==Distribution== Distribution of Ariopelta capensis includes South Africa. == Ecology == Ariopelta capensis serves as the second intermediate host for a parasite, the brachylaimid trematode Renylaima capensis. Unencysted metacercariae, usually brevicaudate, infect the kidney of Ariopelta capensis and differ from mature cercariae by only a slightly greater size. ==References== This article incorporates CC- BY-2.0 text from the referenceSirgel, W.
