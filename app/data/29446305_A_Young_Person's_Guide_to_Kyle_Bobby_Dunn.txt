A Young Person's Guide is a double album release from Canadian composer Kyle Bobby Dunn. It was recorded over a period of six years in Greensboro, North Carolina, Calgary, Alberta, Cypress Hills, Saskatchewan, and parts of New York and New Jersey. The album is largely made up of minimal compositions crafted and produced by processed classical instruments, electric guitar and piano. Most songs surpass the 10-minute mark in long droning suites with two shorter piano-led vignettes that balance out the second disc. Some sounds seem to be gathered from natural elements, static, old video or television dialogues, and other quiet samples. Four pieces from the beginning of the album were released in April 2009 as a digital download from the Brooklyn label Moodgadget. ==Critical reception== The album was generally praised by critics. Ned Raggett, writing for Allmusic, stated: Delusions of Adequacy music journalists, Mark Lesseraux and Greg Argo, rewarded the album by writing: Peter Van Cooten heavily praised the album – expressing an emotionality that separated it largely from other guitar and drone based musics.
