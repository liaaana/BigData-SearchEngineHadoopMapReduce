The two countries have also established an extensive level of trust through their relations during the G20 Summit and both have large investment into multiple anti terror and humanitarian corporations.

The Sharia is the primary source of legislation but the actual promulgation of legislation and implementation of policy is often mitigated by more mundane factors, such as political expediency, the inner politics of the ruling family and the influence of intertribal politics, which remain strong in the kingdom.

In Saudi Arabia, the legal system requires all women to have a male guardian, this guardian has authority to make a number of decisions on behalf of women, similar to that of a minor. Women were only granted the right to vote in the 2015 elections. This progressive landmark change in law created a monumental shift on the lives of Saudi Arabian women and the stigma behind being a woman in Saudi Arabia. There was some hesitation to register to vote as there was still a lot of bureaucratic chores that accompanied the registration process with statistics from a 2020 article from news journal ‘Foreign Policy’ that women only makeup 6% of the 1.7 million people electorate. ==Living conditions== ===Compound living=== Most expats living in Saudi Arabia find themselves living in Western compounds, this housing is like living in a small self-contained holiday village that can have a range of amenities with anything from multiple pools to restaurants, markets and even shopping malls.
